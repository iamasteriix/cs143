# pagila-midterm

**Due Date:**

Friday, 11 March at midnight.
There are no extensions for this assignment.

You are not timed on the midterm, and may stop and restart it as many times as you'd like.
If you choose to do so, please be mindful of the collaboration policy.

**Collaboration Policy:**

You may not collaborate with any human on this assignment.
In particular, you cannot:
1. work with another student,
1. or post questions on github.

You are allowed to reference any non-human resource created before the midterm was assigned.
In particular, you are encouraged to reference:
1. a running postgresql instance,
1. your previous assignments,
1. the class notes,
1. and online references.

**Instructions:**

The instructions are essentially the same as for the pagila homeworks:

1. Fork this repository.

1. There are 5 problems in the midterm, each in a separate file in the `sql` folder.
   Each problem is worth 15 points, and the midterm is worth 75 points overall.

   For each problem, write the answer in the .sql file just like you did in the homeworks.
   There is no `expected` output for you to compare your answers against, and no test cases.
   (I will grade your answers manually.)

1. Commit your changes and push them to github.

1. Submit a link to your repo to sakai, along with the statement:
   ```
   I have not collaborated with anyone on this midterm.
   ```
